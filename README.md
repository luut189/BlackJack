## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default, and will be ignore by the `.gitignore` file.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
